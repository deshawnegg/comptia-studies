# AWS EC2 Lab – Launching & Managing a Web Server

This project demonstrates my hands-on practice with **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**.  
The lab covered launching, monitoring, securing, resizing, and protecting an EC2 instance.  
It shows how to deploy a simple web server in the cloud, adjust its resources, and apply safeguards.

---

## 📌 Skills Practiced
- Launching EC2 instances with User Data
- Using tags to organize resources
- Configuring security groups (firewall rules)
- Monitoring instance health and logs
- Resizing instances and EBS storage
- Testing stop/termination protection
- Exploring service limits in AWS

---

## ⚙️ Lab Steps

### 1. Launch Instance
- Region: **N. Virginia (us-east-1)**
- Instance type: **t2.micro**
- AMI: **Amazon Linux 2023**
- Key Pair: **vockey**
- Security Group: **Web Server security group** (no inbound rules initially)
- Storage: **8 GiB (default)**
- Advanced details: Enabled termination protection + added User Data script

**User Data Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
dnf install -y httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
echo '<html><h1>Hello From Your Web Server!</h1></html>' > /var/www/html/index.html

## 🔎 Reflection
This lab helped me understand how to launch and manage virtual servers in AWS.  
I learned how instance types affect cost and performance, how security groups act like firewalls, and how user data scripts can automate server setup.  
Resizing the instance and testing protections showed me how AWS makes scaling and safeguarding easy.
